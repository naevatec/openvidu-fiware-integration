openvidu-fiware-integration
===

OpenVidu is the only WebRTC technology that allows you to apply real-time audio and video filters in a easy way, and with this FIWARE Orion integration you may insert filter generated events as context information in Orion in a very simple and straight forward way.

## Quick start guide

### How to execute the demo (Docker)

To get the openvidu-fiware-integration demo working, you must clone the repo and compile the `fiware-integration` and `openvidu-filters-client` modules using maven:

```sh
## CURRENT FOLDER: <your path>/

git clone https://github.com/naevatec/openvidu-fiware-integration.git
cd openvidu-fiware-integration

# Compile fiware-integration
cd fiware-integration/
mvn clean install

# Compile openvidu-filters-client
cd ../openvidu-filters-client/
mvn clean install
```

Both maven commands are configured to execute a script after the packaging in order to move the `.jar` file into the `docker/` folder.

Now that we have everything compiled, we have to move to the `docker/` folder and execute the docker compose command in order to build two images:

- **kms-platedetector**: this image is created from `kurento/kurento-media-server-dev` including the _platedetector_ filter to use it in the demo. To do that we must ensure that the compiled binaries of the _platedetector_ (`platedetector.tar.gz` file) exist inside the `docker/` folder.
- **java-app**: image from `java:8` used to execute the `.jar`s that we have compiled before.

And launch the following containers:

- **kms**: a kurento-media-server with the platedetector filter.
- **openvidu-server**: a nightly version of openvidu-server (without kms) with all the changes necessary to configure filters and retrieve their event hooks.
    - It connects to **kms** through a websocket in the port `8888`.
    - It requires the secret, the **kms** url, the webhook url and the events that should emit a webhook.
- **fiware-integration-manager**: a node application to serve a web page that allows us to control the cameras, their filters and retrieve the events that they generate.
    - It connects to **orion** using the url configured in the `fiware-integration-manager/frontend/config.json`. Moreover, it connects to **openvidu-server** but the url is retrieved from the camera definition in _Orion_.
- **orion-mongo**: a mongoDB for the **orion** container.
    - It exposes its API in the port `27017`.
- **orion**: the _Orion_ container.
    - It exposes its API in the port `1026`.
- **fiware-integration**: the api that integrates _OpenVidu_ with _Orion_. Moreover, it serves a web page to create a webrtc camera.
    - It requires the url and secret of **openvidu-server**, the url of **orion** and the url of the **openvidu-filters-client** in order to connect to them.
    - It exposes an API and a web page in the port `8080`.
- **openvidu-filters-client**: an auxiliary application to modify the filters in _OpenVidu_. Its documentation is in [https://github.com/codeurjc/openvidu-server-filters-client]().
    - It requires the url and secret of **openvidu-server** in order to connect to it.
    - It exposes an API in the port `9090`.

```sh
## CURRENT FOLDER: <your path>/openvidu-filters-client/

cd ../docker/
docker-compose up -d
```

### How to use the demo

Now that we have everything compiled and running, we can start using the demo.

> **WARN**: probably you should go to the OpenVidu URL `https://localhost:4443` and accept an exception in your web browser before doing the first step, because it uses a self-signed certificate. 

1. The first step is to create a webrtc camera going to `http://localhost:8080`, filling the form (or leaving it empty) and clicking the `CREATE CAMERA` button to create a new camera.
2. Then we have to go to the management web `http://localhost:3000`, select the camera you have already created and update its filter and events to use the _platedetector_ filter. You can also connect to the camera to see what it is recording.
3. Finally print a plate from Spain, put it in front of the camera and see how the event appear in the management web at the bottom. The events are retrieve directly from _Orion_, therefore you don't need the API anymore, just to create, update or remove the camera.
